As the years go by, the WebKitGTK+ hackfest has become a familiar winter friend. All week, we shuffle from the rich cups of café con leche in the hotel buffet to the Igalia offices. After shaking off the Galician rain, we plunk away on laptops as we typically do in our homes and offices. Mildy embarrassed at the absurdity of it, we chat via IRC with the others in the room hashing the fine points of building a WebKit2 port, hardware accelerated rendering, and making the cat videos play. It seems that each time I return, the topics become more and more ambitious. While the first year we worked on simple drag-and-drop support and fixing basic bugs, now we divvy up implementation of complicated features and prepare the release of an entirely new port. It's been a pleasure watching our little hobby project mature and become something really serious and interesting and it's a pleasure to meet year after year in A Coruña to again connect the faces to the handles.<br /><br />As usual, other have done a stellar job of summarizing the hackfest in general, so I'll focus on what I did this year.</div>
