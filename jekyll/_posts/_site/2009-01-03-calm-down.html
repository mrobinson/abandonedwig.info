<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_There_(film)">Being There</a> warms my heart for several reasons. One of the most notable is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Ashby">Hal Ashby</a> managed to turn<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_jones"> a Cheech and Chong song</a> into some kind of religious experience with umbrellas. There is also the unexpected vignette during the ending, which many people seem to hate. I have no idea why.<br /><br />One of the lesser known reasons though, is that it exposes you to some truly awesome music from somewhere you didn't expect. If I had to construct a rigid philosophical framework, I think this would be a major tenet. You might be asking, "What is that unexpected source, Martin?"<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_street"><div style="margin: 0px auto; text-align:center;"><img title="Sesame Street" alt="Sesame Street"  src="http://abandonedwig.info/blog/uploaded_images/sesame_street_logo-798824.gif" border="0" alt="" /></div></a><br /><br />Here's the rundown: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_Sainte-Marie">Buffy Sainte-Marie</a> is talking to Big Bird about some of their interpersonal problems. Big Bird, of course, is suffering unshakable angst, so Buffy is forced to crack it in typical Sesame Street fashion. The music starts at 2:05, by the way.<br /><br /><div style="margin: 0px auto; text-align:center;"><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4oNHAl_d4Y4&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4oNHAl_d4Y4&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /></div></div>
